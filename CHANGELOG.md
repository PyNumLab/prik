# Changelog

This file is the canonical record of user-visible PRIK changes. Add changes to
**Unreleased** as they land, then move them into a versioned section during
release preparation. Versions use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/);
release tags add a leading `v` to the package version.

## Unreleased

_No unreleased changes._

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-03

- First public release under the PRIK name.
- Build importable Python extensions from supported Fortran sources.
- Generate, inspect, edit, and rebuild from semantic `.pyi` contracts.
- Expose the `prik` console command and the equivalent `python -m prik`
  module command.
- Report the installed release through `prik --version` and
  `prik.__version__`.
- Added a complete runnable Reference BLAS correctness example covering all 155
  discovered routines through PRIK, independent mathematical expectations, and
  f2py differential comparisons.
- Moved the repository's authoritative Reference BLAS sources to
  `examples/blas/native/` for shared use by the example, integration tests,
  LAPACK CI build, and build comparison tooling.
- Added a complete Reference LAPACK build and correctness project. It wraps all
  2,062 implementation sources once and explicitly validates the reviewed 127
  SciPy 1.18.0 double-precision real routines against independent mathematical
  invariants and f2py comparisons in the dedicated CI lane.
- Moved the repository's authoritative Reference LAPACK implementation sources
  to `examples/lapack/native/` and updated full-library integration and CI to
  consume that single source owner alongside `examples/blas/native/`.
- Fixed dependency-safe Python argument conversion ordering for wrappers whose
  array extents depend on later native scalar arguments, including padded BLAS
  leading dimensions.
