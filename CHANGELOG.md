# Changelog

This file is the canonical record of user-visible PRIK changes. Add changes to
**Unreleased** as they land, then move them into a versioned section during
release preparation. Versions use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/);
release tags add a leading `v` to the package version.

## Unreleased

- Added a complete runnable Reference BLAS correctness example covering all 155
  discovered routines through PRIK, independent mathematical expectations, and
  f2py differential comparisons.
- Moved the repository's authoritative Reference BLAS sources to
  `examples/blas/native/` for shared use by the example, integration tests,
  LAPACK CI build, and build comparison tooling.
- Fixed dependency-safe Python argument conversion ordering for wrappers whose
  array extents depend on later native scalar arguments, including padded BLAS
  leading dimensions.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-01

- First public release under the PRIK name.
- Build importable Python extensions from supported Fortran sources.
- Generate, inspect, edit, and rebuild from semantic `.pyi` contracts.
- Expose the `prik` console command and the equivalent `python -m prik`
  module command.
- Report the installed release through `prik --version` and
  `prik.__version__`.
