# Runtime Component

## Purpose And Boundaries

`prik/runtime/` provides Python objects used after a generated extension is
imported and the native support compiled into generated bindings. It validates
the operations and descriptor metadata supplied by the extension, retains
required owners, and exposes the NumPy views permitted by completed policy.

Runtime code enforces decisions already made by policy and represented in the
wrapper plan. It does not decide ownership, invent a missing operation, or
select a different view behavior from local descriptor facts.

## A Native Array Handle At Runtime

```text
generated dispatcher + completed capabilities + native backend
  + dtype, rank, ownership, and view policy
  -> NativeArrayHandleBase validation and owner retention
  -> AllocatableArray or PointerArray
  -> state, lifecycle, association, and to_numpy() operations
```

The dispatcher and capabilities come from the completed wrapper plan. The
runtime validates them, retains the owners required for a live NumPy view, and
uses the generated native backend for descriptor and lifecycle work. It never
infers an operation or ownership rule from the declaration alone.

## Local Structure

```text
prik/runtime/
├── handles.py
└── native_support/
    ├── prik_binding.h
    └── LICENSE
```

- [`handles.py`](../../../prik/runtime/handles.py) contains the Python runtime.
  `NativeArrayHandleBase` validates common metadata and completed capabilities.
  `AllocatableArray` adds allocation state, resize, and deallocation;
  `PointerArray` adds association, nullification, allocation, resize, and
  deallocation when supplied.
- `native_support/prik_binding.h` contains header-only CPython/NumPy
  conversion, descriptor, validation, capsule, and release support. Change it
  only with its generated C users and `prik/compiler/native_support.py`.
- `native_support/LICENSE` is distributed with the native payload.

`to_numpy()` returns `None` for absent storage and otherwise applies the
completed view policy. Native argument handoff is performed in the binding
against the planned array contract. A returned NumPy array is a view of native
storage; a caller that needs independent storage must copy it.

## Run The Handle Demonstration

```bash
python3 prik/runtime/handles.py
```

```text
Runtime handle: AllocatableArray
Descriptor kind: allocatable
Initial view: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
Resized shape: (4,)
Generated resize received NumPy extents: True
```

The example creates an allocatable handle, reads its live NumPy view, and
resizes it. The compiler installs the native header into a generated
`binding_support/` directory.

## Change Routes And Evidence

- Change handle protocol, validation, retention, views, or adapters in
  `handles.py`.
- Change the native payload together with its generated users and
  `prik/compiler/native_support.py`.
- Update the native backend ABI version when its callback contract or record
  meaning changes.
- Complete new ownership, lifecycle, operation, or view policy before planning
  rather than selecting it in runtime code.

| Evidence | What it establishes |
| --- | --- |
| [Allocatable runtime tests](../../../tests/fortran/allocatables/runtime/) | Allocation state, operations, descriptor handoffs, and NumPy views. |
| [Pointer runtime tests](../../../tests/fortran/pointers/runtime/) | Association, nullification, pointer descriptors, and views. |
| [Memory-management runtime tests](../../../tests/fortran/memory_management/runtime/) | Owner retention, release, and array handoffs. |
| [Native-support tests](../../../tests/fortran/infrastructure/runtime/) | Bundled payload discovery and installation inputs. |
| [Compiled runtime compatibility](../../../tests/fortran/infrastructure/building/end_to_end/test_runtime_compatibility.py) | The payload and Python runtime working through a real extension. |

An outstanding zero-copy NumPy view cannot be revoked after native
reallocation, deallocation, or pointer reassociation. Users must discard or
copy such views before changing the native storage.
